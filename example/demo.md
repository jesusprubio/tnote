## Markdown

Same syntax as:

- [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) (for markdown)
- [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)

Note: This is not shown in the presentation

## Source code

The [marked-terminal](https://github.com/mikaelbr/marked-terminal) package is used to print, so code is also supported :smile:

```js
console.log('Hi world!');
```

Notes:

- markdown supported also here
- multiple lines
